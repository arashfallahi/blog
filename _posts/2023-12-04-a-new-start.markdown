This post is the first one on my blog, which I have published after a long time. Many years ago, when blogging was becoming popular in my home country, I started writing on my blog. I remember that in 2004, I began with [Blogger][blogger.com]. However, due to some limitations and the smaller population of Persian-speaking audiences on Blogger, I switched to Persian language blogging services and continued writing there. I also experimented with [Wordpress][wordpress.org] on a personal domain and shared hosting for a while, but I stopped writing after several years.

Until today, I have worked on software projects and gained experience. Now, I want to share my experiences and write about coding and the challenges I encounter with it. Additionally, I want to share my other interests, the new things I discover, and the mindset I am eager to document through writing.
